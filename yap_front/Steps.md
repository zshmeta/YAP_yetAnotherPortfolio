YAP - Yet Another Portfolio

Project Structure:
1. Front-end (yap_front)
    - Created using "npx create-react-app"
    - Folders & Files:
        - src/
            - app/
                - Components/   -> Reusable building blocks for UI
                    - Pages/      -> Components representing different pages/screens of the app
                    - Layouts/    -> Components responsible for arranging other components on the page
                - Modules/      -> Contains application logic, data management, and utility functions

2. Back-end (yap_back)
    - Folder structure yet to be determined

Goal: Reproduce a computer's desktop

Current Progress:
- The front-end folder structure has been set up with basic React components.
- No back-end implementation has started yet.

Next Steps:
1. Plan and design the desired desktop layout for the portfolio.
2. Create necessary React components (e.g., windows, icons, taskbar) within the Components folder.
3. Develop application logic for handling user interactions with the desktop interface.
4. Set up the back-end infrastructure to support features like storing project data, handling authentication, and serving content for the portfolio.

5. Develop necessary API endpoints for the back-end to interact with the front-end.
6. Implement state management in the front-end to efficiently manage data between components and API calls.
7. Integrate responsiveness in the design to ensure that the portfolio looks great on various devices and screen sizes.
8. Test different features of the app, such as navigation between pages, interactions with UI elements, and overall user experience.
9. Deploy both front-end and back-end applications to a hosting provider (e.g., Heroku, AWS, Netlify) for public access.
10. Continuously update and maintain the portfolio by adding new projects or updating existing ones.
